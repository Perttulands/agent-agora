## Athena — The Commander

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A woman in classical Greek armour standing on a raised platform. An owl with blazing amber eyes sits on her shoulder — they are one being. She wears a plumed helm with a tall crest. Her left hand holds a round bronze shield (the Aegis) etched with glowing circuit patterns. Her right hand holds a glowing unrolling scroll — dispatch orders going out. A golden thread trails from her left wrist into the distance. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## Argus — The Hound

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A scarred, muscular dog with bared teeth, patrolling alone through a marble colonnade with circuit-veined columns. He wears a spiked bronze collar etched with tally marks. One eye is normal, the other glows red — a scanner. A broken chain leash drags behind him on the stone floor. He is watchful, aggressive, protective. Scars across his muzzle. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## Centurion — The Centaur

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A centaur in bronze chest armour walking through a construction site where small gladiator-builders work on half-stone half-holographic structures. His chest plate has four symbols engraved on it. He carries an inspection hammer in one hand and a red rejection brand in the other. A gold merge seal hangs from his belt. He is inspecting a structure, tapping it with his hammer. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## Oathkeeper — The Spartan Controller

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A Spartan warrior in a long red cloak and bronze breastplate. A leather-bound ledger is strapped across his chest like a bandolier. A chain is wrapped tightly around his left forearm. His right hand holds a spear with a quill tip instead of a blade. His left palm has a glowing brand mark — the Styx brand. He stands with authority and discipline. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## Truthsayer — The Law Keeper

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A figure in dark robes with gold text stitched into the fabric — lines of rules visible in the weave. He wears an oversized bronze monocle over one eye. One hand holds a thick red quill. A heavy bronze-bound book (the Codex) is chained to his belt. His other hand holds a cracked mirror that shows two layers — a clean surface and rot underneath. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## Hermes — The Messenger

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A young god in mid-stride, caught in motion, never standing still. He wears winged sandals that leave trails of data-light behind him. He carries a caduceus — two serpents of light wrapped around a staff. A messenger satchel at his hip overflows with glowing scrolls. A small counter on his belt reads "0 LOST". Speed lines and light trails surround him. Joyful, fast, energetic. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## The Agora — The Workspace (Hero Image)

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A wide open Greek civic space — marble columns with circuit traces running through them. The floor is mosaic — half ancient geometric patterns, half PCB traces. Small fun-looking gladiator characters run everywhere carrying glowing data tablets, building structures that are half marble half hologram. Holographic threads of light connect stations in the air. On a raised platform at the back, a small figure of Athena watches with an owl on her shoulder. Mediterranean sunlight. Busy, alive, slightly chaotic. Warm palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## Ludus Magnus — The Training Ground

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. An open-air sunlit arena with marble walls. Holographic training dummies in four sparring zones marked A, B, C, D. Small gladiator-builders spar and train with light-weapons. Floating score tablets show numbers. An evolution spiral is carved into the arena floor, glowing faintly. Bright, competitive, energetic. Dust motes in the sunlight mixing with data particles. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## The Loom Room — Athena Web

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A vast room with Greek columns. A great loom dominates the center — threads of different luminous colours stretch across it (gold, blue, green, red). Glass and bronze beads are strung on each thread. Where threads split and merge, the git branches are visible. A single golden thread leads from the loom off into the distance. Warm ambient light from the threads themselves. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).

## The Ouroboros — Learning Loop

Illustrated concept art. Ancient Greek meets cyberpunk. A bronze serpent eating its own tail, coiled in a garden. Where it bites, the organic bronze scales transition into circuit board patterns. Fiber optic flowers bloom from the bite point. Four glowing rings mark sections of the serpent's body. A garden grows beneath and around the serpent, fed by what it consumes. Warm dappled light through leaves mixed with digital glow. Warm Mediterranean palette with electric accents. Detailed, painterly. Wide banner (3:1).
