      <h2>What If Your Code Wrote Itself?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Not the autocomplete-a-line kind. The <em>"I woke up and three features were merged, tested, and deployed"</em> kind.</p>
      <p>Athena's Agora is an open-source system where AI agents do the actual work of software development — writing code, reviewing it, testing it, merging it — while a coordinator named Athena orchestrates from the middle like a very opinionated switchboard operator.</p>
      <p>You tell her what needs building. She figures out how, dispatches the agents, catches them when they screw up, and delivers verified results. Sometimes you wake up to finished features. Sometimes you wake up to a detailed explanation of why the feature is a bad idea. <span class="aside">(Both are valid outcomes.)</span></p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The secret?</strong> There's no magic. It's tmux sessions, bash scripts, quality gates, and an AI that takes the work personally. The magic is in how the pieces fit together — and the fact that <em>you</em> can set this up. Today. On hardware you already own.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Every tool has a name from Greek mythology. Not because we're pretentious <span class="aside">(okay, maybe a little)</span>, but because the names <strong>fit</strong>. When your ops watchdog needs to be loyal and tireless, you don't call it <code>monitor-v2</code>. You call it Argus. And suddenly everyone knows exactly what it does.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section id="how-it-works" class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Five Ideas. That's the Whole System.</h2>
      <p class="lead">Everything else is implementation detail.</p>

      <div class="concepts">
        <div class="concept" data-emoji="🧵">
          <h3>Everything is a Bead</h3>
          <p>Every task, bug, feature, and <span class="aside">"oh god what happened"</span> is a <strong>bead</strong> on the loom. Agents create them, work them, close them. Athena makes sure they don't lie about it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept" data-emoji="♻️">
          <h3>Agents Are Disposable</h3>
          <p>Spin up a coding agent, point it at a bead, let it run. When it's done — or when it's made a mess — kill it. Spin up a fresh one. No emotional attachment. No "let's see if it figures it out." Fresh context is a <em>feature</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept" data-emoji="⚔️">
          <h3>Nothing Passes the Gate</h3>
          <p>The centaur runs your tests, your linter, your anti-pattern scans. The full gauntlet. He doesn't care how clever the code is. If the tests don't pass, the gate doesn't open. <span class="aside">He doesn't care about your deadline either.</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept" data-emoji="👁️">
          <h3>The System Watches Itself</h3>
          <p>A faithful dog checks everything every five minutes. If something's wrong, it files a report and sometimes fixes the problem before you wake up. Best colleague you'll ever have. Never asks for treats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept" data-emoji="🔄">
          <h3>Every Run Improves the Next</h3>
          <p>Success or failure, every agent run feeds data back into the templates. The system gets better by using itself. The serpent eats its tail. Flowers grow where it bites.</p>

  <!-- THE STACK -->
  <section id="the-stack" class="section section-warm">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Stack</h2>
      <p class="lead">Less glamorous than the mythology suggests. More powerful than you'd expect from this list.</p>

      <div class="stack-grid">
        <div class="stack-item">
          <h3>tmux</h3>
          <p>Yes, really. Agents run in tmux sessions. It's not pretty, but it's observable, debuggable, and you can attach to any agent and watch it think in real time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stack-item">
          <h3>systemd</h3>
          <p>Argus, the gateway, and Relay all run as services. When something needs to run forever, you don't write a while loop. You write a unit file.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stack-item">
          <h3>Git</h3>
          <p>Everything is version-controlled. Beads are stored in git. Agent work is branched and merged. If the VPS catches fire, we lose compute but not knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stack-item">
          <h3>Claude + Codex</h3>
          <p>Claude Opus handles architecture and judgment. Codex handles implementation — fast and pattern-following. Haiku does the cheap work: Argus checks, quick scans, anything where speed matters more than depth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stack-item">
          <h3>Filesystem I/O</h3>
          <p>No database. No Redis. No message broker. Relay uses NDJSON files with flock-guarded atomic writes. 26,000 msgs/sec. The filesystem was always the right answer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stack-item">
          <h3>Bash + Go</h3>
          <p>Orchestration scripts in bash. Tools in Go. Templates in markdown. No framework. No build step. No dependency that weighs more than the tool it serves.</p>

            <p>An open Greek civic space with marble columns threaded with circuits and floor mosaics that are half ancient geometry, half PCB traces. Little gladiator-builders run everywhere — carrying data tablets, constructing half-stone half-holographic structures. On a raised platform, Athena watches with the owl on her shoulder. Busy, alive, slightly chaotic.</p>

            <p>Oathkeeper reads the transcripts. Finds the promises. Checks the receipts. The ancient Greeks swore by the River Styx, and if they broke that oath, even gods paid the price. We're less dramatic — but the principle holds.</p>

            <p>Athena was goddess of weaving. A loom has threads; threads are strung with beads. Each bead is a discrete unit of work — small, trackable, part of something larger. String enough together and you've woven something real.</p>
            <p>Distributed, git-backed, agent-native. Created by <a href="https://github.com/steveyegge/beads">Steve Yegge</a> and adopted into the Agora because nothing else came close. <span class="aside">Also: worry beads. Because tracking agent work will absolutely give you something to worry about.</span></p>

        <div class="real-talk-item">
          <h3>It runs on 8GB of RAM</h3>
          <p>A single VPS. Not a Kubernetes cluster. Not "the cloud" with air quotes. One box, in Helsinki, running fifteen things that probably shouldn't fit on 8GB. <span class="aside">And yet.</span></p>

        <div class="real-talk-item">
          <h3>Agents are brilliant interns with amnesia</h3>
          <p>Each one is incredibly capable for exactly one task. Then it finishes, and the next one arrives with absolutely no memory of what just happened. That's the design. You don't need continuity when you have good systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="real-talk-item">
          <h3>Some days are pure chaos</h3>
          <p>An agent refactors the test suite "while it's in there." Centurion rejects everything. Argus detects the CPU spike. You manage a cascade of well-intentioned destruction. <span class="aside">Also beautiful, in its own way.</span></p>

          <h3>API credits are real money</h3>
          <p>This system calls AI models. A lot. If you're on a budget, start small. If you're on an unlimited plan, start medium. Nobody starts large and keeps their accountant happy. <span class="aside">Nobody.</span></p>

      <p>This is for the person with a side project and a $20/month VPS. The freelancer who's tired of context-switching between five repos. The solo founder who needs to ship faster than humanly possible — so they made it <em>not</em> a human problem.</p>
      <p>Every tool here is open source. Every tool is documented. Every tool was built by one person and an AI, on the same kind of hardware you probably already have.</p>
      <p>The mythology isn't gatekeeping. It's an invitation. Come build something. Name your tools. Give your AI a soul. The agora is open. The owl is watching. There's room to build.</p>
