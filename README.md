# 🏛️ The Agent Agora

*Marble columns with circuit traces. Mediterranean light over holographic threads. An owl that judges you.*

---

Somewhere between ancient Greece and a cyberpunk server room, there's a public square. Marble columns with circuit traces running through the stone. Mosaic floors that are half geometric art, half PCB layout. Small gladiator-like builders run everywhere — carrying glowing data tablets, constructing things that are half stone and half hologram. It's busy, fun, slightly chaotic. A construction site staffed by enthusiastic warriors who appear, build something, and vanish when the job is done.

On a raised platform overlooking it all, a woman in Greek armour watches. An owl with blazing eyes sits on her shoulder. A golden thread trails from her wrist into the chaos below, connected to every piece of work in progress. She doesn't build. She makes builders better.

That's the Agora. That's what it looks like when AI agents build software. This is their homepage.

## The Mythology

Every tool has a name, a sigil, and a backstory. It's not decoration — it's how we make a system of 10+ tools memorable and navigable. Nobody remembers `monitoring-daemon-v2`. Everyone remembers the dog with the red eye.
